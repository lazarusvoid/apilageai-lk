Updated memory from GPT: - Primary key, candidate key, and superkey are key concepts in the relational model of databases. Primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table, candidate keys are alternate keys that could also function as primary keys, and superkey is a set of attributes that uniquely identifies tuples.
- Maintaining minimality in primary keys is essential to ensure uniqueness and efficiency in database operations. For example, a minimal primary key in a "Students" table could be the "student_id" because it uniquely identifies each student record.
- Referential integrity ensures relationships between tables remain consistent. In case of a violation, CASCADE deletes related records, SET NULL sets foreign key values to NULL, and RESTRICT prevents the update/delete operation.
- Domain constraints specify acceptable values for attributes, enhancing data integrity. For instance, a "gender" attribute might have a domain constraint of 'M' or 'F' to maintain data consistency.
- Specialization involves creating subclasses based on common attributes, while generalization groups entities with common features. For example, in EER modeling, a "Vehicle" general entity can have specialized subclasses like "Car" and "Motorcycle." Completeness constraints determine if all entities must belong to a subclass, while disjointness constraints ensure entities are exclusive to one subclass.
- Terms:
  - Subclass: A subset of entities with shared attributes and relationships, e.g., "Electric Cars" as a subclass of "Cars."
  - Shared subclass: A subclass that can have multiple superclasses, e.g., "Flying Vehicle" as a subclass of both "Airplane" and "Helicopter."
  - Category (union type): Entities belong to multiple subclasses, sharing common attributes, e.g., a "Pet" could be a "Dog" or a "Cat."
  - Predicate-defined subclass: Entities grouped based on satisfying certain conditions, e.g., "High-income Customers" as a subclass in a "Customer" entity.
  - Attribute-defined specialization: Entities specialized based on attributes, e.g., "Employee" entity specialized as "Manager" and "Developer" based on the "Role" attribute.
GPT memory triggered
Updated memory from GPT: - Understanding the distinction between superkey, candidate key, and primary key is vital in database design. A superkey is a set of attributes that uniquely identifies tuples, a candidate key is an alternate key that can also function as a primary key, and a primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table.
- In database design, maintaining minimality in primary keys is crucial for efficiency and ensuring data uniqueness. For instance, "student_id" as a minimal primary key in a "Students" table guarantees unique identification of each student record.
- Referential integrity is essential for consistent relationships between tables. Violations could lead to cascading deletions, setting foreign key values to NULL, or restricting update/delete operations.
- Domain constraints play a significant role in data integrity within a relational schema. For instance, a "gender" attribute's domain constraint of 'M' or 'F' maintains data consistency.
- Specialization in Enhanced ER (EER) modeling involves creating subclasses based on common attributes, while generalization groups entities with shared features. Completeness constraints determine if all entities must belong to a subclass, while disjointness constraints ensure exclusivity to one subclass.
